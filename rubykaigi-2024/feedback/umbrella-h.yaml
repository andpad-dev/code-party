    Yes, I had fun participating in this collaboration and observing the thinking processes and communication of skilled engineers.
    One of the members brought a practical problem with a well-defined boundary, suitable for a 2 hour discussion in my opinion.
    @cindyliu923 and I were the only two non-native Japanese speakers in the group, but with a mix of slow-spoken Japanese, a bit of English, and sketches on a whiteboard (and of course, in Ruby!), everyone was kind and patient in explaining their thoughts and the challenges we faced.
    There were some interesting challenges that I had never considered before and plan to explore further...
    For example, when we tried to check some variables with binding.irb and pp, no new clues were revealed.
    Someone suggested this might be due to two running rspec processes, another member proposed using IO.write, and another found some critical typos.
    In the end, we made some progress together!

  groups:
    # どのグループに参加しましたか？
    # Which groups did you join?
    - rspec-openai
  etc:
    # なにか思ったことがあれば自由に書いてください。
    # Please give us any feedback.

    I am really grateful to the hosts for arranging this extraordinary event! The experience was truly inspiring ~
    Initially, I intended to join two rounds on different topics and try to collaborate with some esteemed contributors, but I found it challenging to do so within a 2-3 hour time limitation.
    Considering that unless someone is quite experienced in the community, it's difficult for an individual to gather people and organize such an event, including food and venue... I sincerely hope this event is held every year. If possible, please organize more of them!
