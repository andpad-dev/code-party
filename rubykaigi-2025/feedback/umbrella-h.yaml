      I had a wonderful time! tompng-san was so gentle and patient 😭. He began with an introduction to basic ASCII art syntax, followed by an analysis of award-winning TRICK entries to highlight common techniques. 

      Special thanks to Tada-san for assisting me with debugging and sharing his approach to making quines more readable.

      Yamashita-san, inspired by the Matsuyama specialty 'taruto' on the table, attempted to draw a spiral. This inspired me to experiment with creating different flavors of taruto in code.

      Although my resulting code logic turned out quite messy, I explored [arranging the code itself into a visual pattern](https://github.com/umbrella-h/code-party-2025-TRICK/blob/main/taruto/entry.rb).
      While it’s not a perfect Quine, it felt like a meaningful step forward, bringing me a little bit closer to understanding the world of TRICK.

      Everyone was very considerate of my limited Japanese, which made it possible for me to enjoy the event stress-free 🙏🏼.

    I appreciated the format of having pre-announced themes alongside a free discussion group.
    As a beginner, I could immediately dive into a theme with guidance from the hosts, while also having the opportunity to listen to discussions among more experienced participants.
    Although it felt a bit more crowded than last year's venue (🥲), the participants were friendly and welcoming, so I still had a great time.
    (Oh! And the onigiri were delicious! I even took 3 extra ones for my morning picnic. 🍙)
